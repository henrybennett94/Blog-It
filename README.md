## Introduction

Blog It! is a Django web application, intended to give users a streamlined platform for making, updating and managing posts that celebrate the beauty and history of treasured relics from the past! The intended audience is for people with an interest in historical antiques and artifacts, from any period, so that they have a dedicated online space to celebrate this passion by reading and/or posting about. In this way, the application is intended to have full CRUD functionality and user authentication, meaning users of the service can create their own account on the application, on which they have the agency to create, update, and delete posts and comments as logged-in users.

## UX Design

This application was designed using Balsamiq to create wireframes. The method of the design was to conform to user stories.

### MVP

The MVP provides users with an interest in the subject, though anyone is welcome to join, with an application they can quickly sign up with, and then use to create and read about interesting facts and stories related to different historical antiques, with the option to comment on other account-holders' posts, and delete and edit these posts.


### User Stories for Blog It!:

- As a site user I can access my user account through a login form requiring a password so that my account's security is maintained.

## Technology used
Blog It! leverages several modern web development technologies, with the intention to create an engaging and interactive user experience. The key technologies used are Python, HTML CSS, JavaScript, Django, and Cloudinary.

### Python
Python is an object-oriented general purpose programming language used popularly in supporting web development. Using Python in a Django project enables the creation of powerful web applications by leveraging Django's high-level framework for clean, scalable, and maintainable code.
### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of the web pages in this application. It provides the skeleton for the app's interface, defining elements such as buttons, images, and text content.
### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the HTML elements. It enhances the visual presentation of the app by controlling the layout, colors, fonts, and overall look and feel.
### JavaScript
JavaScript enhances a Django application by enabling dynamic, interactive user interfaces, streamlining the development process.
### Django
Django is a Python web framework ideal for projects due to its robust scalability, offering rapid development, built-in security features, and a clean, pragmatic design. Its capabilities facilitate a well-structured development environment and enable a straightforward interface between application and database. 
### Cloudinary
Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that provides powerful tools for managing, optimizing, and delivering images and videos in web and mobile applications. Offering seamless media management and optimized delivery, it is an expedient tool for storing media in a Django application.

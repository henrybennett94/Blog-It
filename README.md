## Introduction

Blog It! is a Django web application, intended to give users a streamlined platform for making, updating and managing posts that celebrate the beauty and history of treasured relics from the past! The intended audience is for people with an interest in historical antiques and artifacts, from any period, so that they have a dedicated online space to celebrate this passion by reading and/or posting about. In this way, the application is intended to have full CRUD functionality and user authentication, meaning users of the service can create their own account on the application, on which they have the agency to create, update, and delete posts and comments as logged-in users.

------

## UX Design

### MVP

The MVP provides users with an interest in the subject, though anyone is welcome to join, with an application they can quickly sign up with, and then use to create and read about interesting facts and stories related to different historical antiques, with the option to comment on other account-holders' posts, and delete and edit these comments.

### User Stories for Blog It!:

1. As a site user I can view a paginated list of posts so that I can select which post I want to view.
2. As a site user I can access my user account through a login form requiring a password so that my account's security is maintained.
3. As a site user I can create a user account with a username and password so that access to how I use the site is private to me and protected.
4. As a site user I can get asked to confirm that I wish to delete a feature, after selecting a delete option so that the risk of accidentally deleting something is minimised.
5. As a site user I can leave comments on a post so that I can be involved in the conversation.
6. As a site admin I can approve or disapprove comments so that I can filter out objectionable comments.
7. As a site user or admin I can view comments on an individual post so that I can read the conversation.
8. As a site user I can have the option to delete my posts and comments that I no longer need there so that I can keep my user space organised, updated and relevant.
9. As a site user I can click on a post so that I can read the full text.
10. As a site admin I can create draft posts so that I can finish writing the content later.
11. As a site admin I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage my blog content.
12. As a site user I can like others' posts so that I can show appreciation for other site users' content.

This application was designed using Balsamiq to create wireframes. The approach of the design was to conform to user stories, utilising a 'Mobile-first' approach to ensure responsivity would be developed and maintained.

### Sample Project Wireframes

## Agile Development

The project was developed using Agile Methodology. User stories were mapped to a Github Projects project board to chart development progress, with four sections: 'To Do'- the backlog, 'In Progress'- initial developments, and 'Done'- to mark the story as completed. User Stories were also mapped to Issues, listed in the 'Issues' tab in the Github repository, and assigned between three milestones: 'Blog Posts', 'User Authentication', and 'User CRUD'. A fourth milestone, 'Future Features' exists for User Stories that were assigned 'Won't' in MoSCoW prioritisation, but can be developed in future iterations.

### MoSCoW 

User stories were worked on according to a MoSCoW prioritisation system, assigning four labels ('Must', 'Should', 'Could', 'Won't') to each story to be able to work towards achieving the MVP for this iteration.

| User Story | MoSCoW | Milestone |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- |
| 1          | Must   | Blog Posts|
| 2          | Must   | User Auth |
| 3          | Must   | User Auth |
| 4          | Should | User CRUD |
| 5          | Must   | User CRUD |
| 6          | Could  | Blog Posts|
| 7          | Must   | User CRUD |
| 8          | Must   | User CRUD |
| 9          | Must   | User CRUD |
| 10         | Could  | Blog Posts|
| 11         | Must   | Blog Posts|
| 12         | Won't  | Future Features |

## Technology used
Blog It! leverages several modern web development technologies, with the intention to create an engaging and interactive user experience. The key technologies used are Python, HTML CSS, JavaScript, Django, and Cloudinary.

### Python
Python is an object-oriented general purpose programming language used popularly in supporting web development. Using Python in a Django project enables the creation of powerful web applications by leveraging Django's high-level framework for clean, scalable, and maintainable code.
### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of the web pages in this application. It provides the skeleton for the app's interface, defining elements such as buttons, images, and text content.
### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the HTML elements. It enhances the visual presentation of the app by controlling the layout, colors, fonts, and overall look and feel.
### JavaScript
JavaScript enhances a Django application by enabling dynamic, interactive user interfaces, streamlining the development process.
### Django
Django is a Python web framework ideal for projects due to its robust scalability, offering rapid development, built-in security features, and a clean, pragmatic design. Its capabilities facilitate a well-structured development environment and enable a straightforward interface between application and database. 
### Cloudinary
Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that provides powerful tools for managing, optimizing, and delivering images and videos in web and mobile applications. Offering seamless media management and optimized delivery, it is an expedient tool for storing media in a Django application.

### Unit Testing
The project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the functionality of key features, specifically related to blog post details and the comment system. Below is an overview of the provided unit tests:

Test Files

test_views.py: Contains tests for the blog views, including rendering of post details and comment submission.
test_forms.py: Contains tests for the comment form validation.

Blog Views Unit Tests (test_views.py)
test_render_post_detail_page_with_comment_form:

- Verifies that the blog post detail page renders correctly.
- Ensures that the response contains the correct post title, content, and that a CommentForm instance is passed into the context.

test_successful_comment_submission:

- Tests the process of submitting a comment.
- Simulates a logged-in user posting a comment on a blog post.
- Verifies that the comment submission is successful and that the response indicates the comment is awaiting approval.

Comment Form Unit Tests (test_forms.py)
test_form_is_valid:

- Tests whether the CommentForm is valid when provided with a valid comment body.
- Ensures the form passes validation.

test_form_is_invalid:

- Tests the CommentForm when an empty comment body is submitted.
- Verifies that the form is invalid, ensuring proper validation is enforced.

Running the Tests 

Used command:

python manage.py test

in the terminal to execute all the tests and provide feedback on any failures or issues.

Key Test Observations:
Tests involving rendering the post detail page (with comment form) passed, meaning the page loaded without issues, even when no comments were present.
The form validation test, checking if a comment can be successfully submitted and awaiting approval, passed as expected.
Conclusion:
The unit tests confirm that the core features, including the post detail page, comment submission, and comment form validation, are functioning correctly. Since no tests failed, it indicates that the code is stable and free of errors based on the current test coverage.

### Resolved Bugs

#### Paragraph Tag Validation
An HTML validation error was identified in post_detail.html when using the W3C Validator, specifically involving an unclosed <p> tag within the post content section.

Resolution:
To address this, the post content has been wrapped in a <div> element instead of a <p> tag. This change resolves the validation issue while maintaining the intended structure and styling for the content.
